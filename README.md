# embedding-notebook4
This notebook contains programs for calculating transport properties of electrons through kinks in waveguides, and is an extension of Notebook 3. A variety of shapes of kink can be treated, and this enables a wide range of behaviour to be studied. As in both Notebooks 2 and 3, the confinement of the wave-function by the waveguide is described by a confining embedding potential, and the embedding method is also used to match the wave-function on to extended straight sections of waveguide. In this notebook I have used Python classes, which simplifieds the coding compared with the earlier notebooks, and also gives the flexibility needed to treat the different types of kink.  
The notebook uses the `matplotlib` and `numpy` modules, as well as the `kink_class.py` module contained in the repository. This module uses `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `cmath`, and `scipy`. It also imports `warnings`, to suppress occasional harmless warnings which occur when making the contour plots.
